        Projects
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Automated Robocar (buggy)- based on Arduino microcontroller</li>
        <p>
            The Buggy moves around the track in clock wise direction, being able to detect obstacles,
    communicate state of track and buggy at each gantry stop to the console and then parks safely. Contributed to major part of programming of the Robocar and slightly to electronic circuits
        </p>
        <li> IOT based Motion detecting camera- based on ESP-32 and PIR sensor</li>
        <p>
            The camera clicks pictures as soon as it detects any sort of motion with the help of PIR sensor. ESP32 microcontroller was used for programming of the camera.
